# Linear-Regression
Abstract:

Have you ever asked yourself, how are diamonds priced? Well, this project talks about the 
diamonds price prediction based on their cut, color, clarity & other attributes and it also covers 
the building a simple linear regression model using Python.

Design:

This project is one of the T5 Data Science Boot Camp requirements. Data provided by Kaggle.
In this module, we will be laying the foundation for our analysis by processing and exploring a 
large amount of data on diamond datasets. This dataset has been made available thanks to Kaggle 
which is the home for many such datasets and competitions.

Understanding the dataset:

This dataset considered the classic Diamonds dataset which contains the prices and other 
attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds and this dataset is hosted on Kaggle. The dataset contains 
53940 rows and 10 variables. Before jumping into building the model, letâ€™s have a look into the 
variables & their definitions.

Price: price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)
Carat: weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)
Cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
Color: diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)
Clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, 
VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
X: length in mm (0--10.74)
Y: width in mm (0--58.9)
Z: depth in mm (0--31.8)
Depth: total depth percentage = z / mean (x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)
Table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)
